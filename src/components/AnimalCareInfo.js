            during the euthanasia visit, so you do not have to go through it alone. I am also more than happy to spend
            some time with you afterwards. It is always helpful to have someone to talk to.

          <h2 style={h2Styles}>Julie and Ralph</h2>
          <p style={pStyles}>Beau is the absolute best! Like many pet owners, my pup, Ralph, means the
            world to me
            and it takes a lot for me
            to trust someone. Beau always keeps me updated on the walks and any new friends that Ralph makes. His
            daily
            recap texts include pictures which I joke is like I hired a professional photographer as an added bonus.
            I think
            the favorite part of Ralph's day is when Beau arrives, he knows he'll get fresh air, lots of love and a
            few
            treats.

          <h2 style={h2Styles}>Anna + Anna and Ruthie</h2>
          <p style={pStyles}>From the moment our Ruthie met Beau, she was in love. We say his name and her
            tail
            wags
            with delight. And if we
            had tails, we would wag them too! Beau is communicative and professional, clear and detailed with his
            walking
            reports and pet sits. We trust him profoundly with our excitable and sometimes too stubborn mini
            goldendoodle.
            He loves her as if she was his own, with great care and compassion. When he walks her, our busy lives
            are made
            easier. We come home to a happily walked and calm dog after each and every visit. We couldnâ€™t recommend
            Beau
            with higher praise and feel lucky that Ruthie gets to spend time with him.

          <h2 style={h2Styles}>Vanessa and River</h2>
          <p style={pStyles}>Admittedly, it's not easy for me to leave my pup, River, with anyoneâ€¦ except for
            Beau. I
            met Beau at a nearby dog park and knew instantly that he was a genuine and compassionate animal lover.
            He proves
            that time and time again, going above and beyond to keep River happy and safe. Beau is thoughtful,
            dependable,
            responsible, and incredibly kind. He communicates thoroughly and sends detailed summaries (with adorable
            photographs!) after every walk. We are incredibly grateful that we found Beau and could not possibly
            recommend
            him more!</p>

          <p style={pStyles}>I can't recommend Beau enough. Above all, he values each pet's safety and
            comfort.
            He is
            passionate about connecting with and understanding the needs of animals, which I have seen in his
            connection
            with Java, our 15 year old goldendoodle. Beau is reliable, communicative, and extremely thoughtful, and
            Java is
            consistently excited to see him. Beau took time to get to know Java and we are so grateful to put her in
            his

          <p style={pStyles}>I highly recommend Beau as a dog walker and dog sitter. Beau has been regularly
            walking
            our dog Moose and has consistently provided excellent care, and our dog absolutely loves him! Beau is
            extremely
            reliable, and always goes above and beyond to make sure Moose is happy and has a good walk. Beauâ€™s
            extremely
            accommodating of our schedules, and has saved us on multiple occasions when we last minute needed dog
            care. Iâ€™m
            really thankful for his flexibility and kindness. Beau has dog sat for Moose on several occasions and
            has always provided exceptional care during his stays. He
            sends regular updates about walks / dog sits and provides awesome pictures with each update. I trust
            Beau completely and am so grateful to have him as Moose's dog walker and dog sitter.</p>
